Finding the shortest path between two given nodes in a graph with weights assigned to arcs. The graph is defined in a file as a parameter to the task.

It's assumed that there is at most one arc between any two nodes. The graph is connected, i.e. there is a path between any two nodes. Any node can be visited no more than two times.

The implemented Java program use [GraphStream](https://graphstream-project.org/) for UI presentation.
